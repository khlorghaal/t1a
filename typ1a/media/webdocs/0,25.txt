This update took like 5x longer than planned, but I don't like working on the same thing for too long, so I ended up getting a ton of stuff done, including new features that haven't been announced yet.

====
-Added grenades.

-Added smoke grenades.
The current smoke effect has low particle count and has issues with draw order affecting transparency, although it still looks amazing. It is a placeholder until I can figure out GL instancing; 
the finished effect will be done mostly on GPU, so it will have high particle count and won't lag.

-Grenades are dyeable. Simply craft them with a vanilla dye.
====

====
Complex crafting and durability system for smallarms. Will explain in video.

-Added temporary crafting for parts. Will change once IC2 added
-Decrafting allows for removing attachments or breaking a gun into its parts.

-Individual guns parts have individual durability. Once a part breaks the gun needs reassembled.
Once a part gets below 20% durability:
Barrel: +30% spread
Stock: +30% recoil
Bolt: +5% chance to jam
Action: +5% chance to jam

All guns have a 1/250 chance to jam on every shot
When jammed, shift+[reload] to forward assist

-Added gun attachments
Scope: decreases FoV to 10deg and adds mildots, todo calibrate mildots. I've decided to make scopes permanently zoomed; otherwise everyone would always use one all the time; this forces players to make a tactical decision
Suppressor: removes muzzle flash and makes gun very quiet, increases bullet spread
Muzzle brake: Decreases recoil, increases loudness(distance heard) and flash

-Added Masterwork gun parts
On crafting a gun part, there is a 1/20 chance for it to be a masterwork.
The idea is that it will be impractical to craft parts just to get one, and they will be a highly valued trade commodity.
Masterwork parts have different effects:
Stock: decreases recoil
Barrel: increases accuracy and speed
Action: increases accuracy
Bolt: increases speed
All have 2x durability

-FINALLY after literally DAYS of troubleshooting, bullets now behave perfectly. IT WAS BECAUSE VANILLA WAS SCREWING WITH THEM. HURRRRRRR. HURRRRRRRRRRRR.
-Wrote my own Entity class for bullets and other things from scratch. Very minimal, and Client and Server instances are unsynchronized, causing about 10* better performance.

I tried perfecting the algorithm for projectile movement, but I spent an entire day on it and got nowhere. However the current algorithm is good enough for bullets moving at non-sanic speeds.

-Full automatics work properly on dedicated server now
Client and server each do projectiles independently. This may cause issues with hitting moving targets? Please report findings.

-Projectiles are no longer saved. This is to prevent the small possibility of an infinite loop or lag ruining a World

-Projectiles now interact with water realisticly

-Reloading non-magazine weapons (currently only the shotgun) cycles properly and is no longer mashable.

-Added reload sound

-Weapons stay held up a few seconds after firing.
Because of vanilla's horridly inconsistent methodology, this simple feature took 4 hours to figure out. The solution is amazingly convoluted.

-Bullets now ignore the red flash invulnerability
Causes shotguns and smg to work much more realistically now. Nerfed their damage by a lot.

====
-Added ammo system with different bullet types
Was talking with Flan and he said his guns simply store their ammo stacks in their NBT, took this brilliantly simple princple to make a stack(as in push-pop) based ammo system.
First rounds loaded are the last rounds fired

-Ammo chambering works exactly like real guns.
shift+[reload,default:r] to rack, pulling the bolt back and releasing it; will eject the round currently in chamber if there is one, and will chamber the next round in the magazine.
If all rounds are fired before reloading, will need racked after reloading.

-Added magazine loading gui, right click when holding a magazine.
Todo make a machine block for reloading.

Tracer: normal bullet, just glowy
High Explosive: +20% damage (floored) destroys blocks with <41 blast resist on hit. Shotgun HE launches a small grenade.

-Vehicles are driveable again. It took me 2 hours to find out that the problem was I was setting position wrong when constructing :c

-Further refined packet system, complex vehicle keybinding, and tracking keys for multiple players in the same vehicle, are now possible

-Vehicle motion is now smooth
The current method I'm using is server-enforced rubberbanding. It works very nicely in a low jitter environment at non-fast speeds, and is unhackable.

-Test mech equipped with temporary gun for testing.

-Drop pods "work".
Launch themselves in the air as soon as you get in, which is temporary.

Known bugs
The slot a grenade is in on client does not update after being thrown
