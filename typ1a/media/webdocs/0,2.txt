After multiple lazy streaks which had many people worried, including myself, here it is.

I've not finished nearly as much stuff as I should have in this amount of time, although Thutmose has done a ton, namely the explosions.


Alpha 0.2 for 1.6.2, forge 9.10.0.789
Assume it will eat your worlds and all you hold dear. It is absolutely necessary to make backup Worlds before using.
Is still somewhat buggy/crashy, especially the nukes, do not detonate more than one at a time or shoot them into unloaded chunks.
Don't bother reporting bugs/crashes unless you think it's something especially freaky.


-Dedicated server works. 
-"Open to LAN" may not work properly for some things. It probably never will as I dont care :d.
-Everything works in SMP, afaik. Report things which behave differently in SMP/SSP.

-Added creative tab

-Added explosions, very fast and realistic, multithreaded, fallout. Vfx are "done" but dont work.
-For demonstration/testing, TOW missiles are temporarily small nukes
-IRBMs no longer fly retard
-Added concrete. It flows and hardens and stuff. Thut is going to make it into a standalone mod, which I will still package with t1a.

-Added a client-server autosynchronizing GUI API (yes, I made an API for an API, vanilla is that bad), GUIs are easy to make now.
-Everything with equipment now has an equipment screen separate from its other GUIs
-Toggle button to make input coordinates for things either relative or absolute. [REL/ABS]
-Improved sentries overall; added a GUI with various behavior settings, unimplemented.

-Added handheld suspensors - fully working.
It's very difficult to implement fall damage based on player velocity, so I'm leaving fall damage off for now (the suspensor needs to be active).

I can now say with no doubt that T1A is the best gun mod.
-Added assault rifle
-Bullets shatter windows, glass, and glowstone. Will later add config option for which blocks can break.
-Fixed semi-autos being mashable.
-Fixed bullets in loading chunks causing recoil
-Added motion blur.
-Added muzzle flash.
-Rifle bolt animation finished
-Bullets now pass around corners perfectly.
-Bullets now spawn at the end of the gun barrel and not the center of the player. The placement is currently not good, will work on that later.

Ricochet mechanics
-Added realistic ricochet
This is what I've spent the bulk of my time on, and I only got it working by using an imperfect algorithm. Bullets have a tendency to think the ground is higher than it actually is. I have no idea why atm.

-Bullet Damage scales with speed.
-Faster bullet and steeper angle with less blast resistant block -> less chance to ricochet.
-Ricochet speed reduction decreases with higher blast resist.
Basically, shotgun in obsidian corridor = deadly. Use sand/dirt to catch enemy bullets in your forts' hallways.

-Fixed vehicles, then broke them again.


I will make a minor 0.25 update soon for a few things including adjusting gun visual positioning, tracer rounds, gernades, and bettering reloading.

Next big update will be focused on mechs/vehicles, will have prototype orbital lasers, and perhaps working nuke vfx.
